# LinearRegression
This repository contains my first implementation of a linear regression model. The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of supervised learning, focusing on predicting a target variable based on a single or multiple input features.

# Key Features:
Implementation of linear regression from scratch or using a library like scikit-learn.
1. A dataset to train and test the model.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into the dataset.
3. Visualization of the regression line and performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   
# Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
How to Use:
Instructions to run the code on google colab notebook.

# Goals:
1. Understand the working of linear regression.
2. Learn how to evaluate model performance.
3. Practice hands-on coding of machine learning models.
   
Feel free to use this project to learn or contribute!
